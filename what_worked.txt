Solar System Visualization - Successful Changes

1. Planet Visibility Fixes:
- Added `!important` to all planet styles to override any conflicting styles
- Forced opacity to 1 for all planets with `opacity: 1 !important`
- Added `background-color: currentColor !important` to ensure planet backgrounds render
- Moved planet names further up (35px instead of 25px) to prevent overlap with planets

2. Planet Dimensions:
Implemented specific sizes for each planet:
- Jupiter: 40px
- Saturn: 35px
- Uranus: 26px
- Neptune: 25px
- Earth: 20px
- Venus: 18px
- Mars: 16px
- Mercury: 12px
- Pluto: 10px

3. Style Enforcement:
- Added `!important` to width and height properties
- Added `!important` to background gradients
- Forced `display: block` and `visibility: visible` on both containers and planets
- Ensured proper z-indexing based on y-position for layering

4. Container Properties:
- Set container width and height to 0
- Maintained transform-origin at 50% 50%
- Ensured containers remain visible with `display: block` and `visibility: visible`

5. Update Interval:
- Set to 5 seconds (5000ms) for smooth updates

6. Asteroid Implementation:
- Added 10 major asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
- Integrated with NASA Horizons API using correct asteroid IDs
- Implemented proper sizing hierarchy (Ceres: 14px to smallest: 8px)
- Used dashed orbit lines to distinguish from planet orbits
- Added golden text for asteroid names to differentiate from planets
- Positioned orbits between 480-580px (between Mars at 440px and Jupiter at 640px)
- Used brown gradient colors to represent rocky composition
- Successfully integrated real-time position updates from NASA data
- Implemented fallback to calculated positions using accurate orbital periods

7. Asteroid Styling:
- Custom hover effects with scale and glow
- Proper z-index handling for layering with planets
- Smaller name labels (12px) with gold color
- Semi-transparent dashed orbits for less visual clutter
- Maintained visibility with !important rules

8. Comet Implementation:
- Added 10 significant comets with accurate orbital data
- Integrated with NASA Horizons API using proper comet designations
- Implemented dynamic comet tails that always point away from the sun
- Used cyan/blue color scheme to distinguish comets from planets and asteroids
- Added blur effect to comet tails for realistic appearance
- Sized comets appropriately (Halley: 16px to smallest: 10px)
- Used dotted orbit lines to differentiate from planets and asteroids
- Implemented proper layering with z-index based on position
- Added hover effects with name display and glow

9. Comet Styling:
- Unique cyan gradient for comet heads
- Glowing effect using box-shadow
- Gradient-based tails with blur filter
- Semi-transparent dotted orbits
- Cyan text color for names
- Dynamic tail rotation based on position relative to sun
- Proper 3D transforms for perspective view

10. Spacecraft Implementation:
- Added 10 major spacecraft with accurate positioning:
  - Voyager 1 & 2 (deep space missions)
  - James Webb Space Telescope (at L2 point)
  - International Space Station (Earth orbit)
  - Hubble Space Telescope (Earth orbit)
  - Parker Solar Probe (solar orbit)
  - New Horizons (deep space)
  - Cassini (historical Saturn position)
  - Juno (Jupiter orbit)
  - MAVEN (Mars orbit)
- Integrated NASA Horizons API for real-time positions
- Implemented fallback calculations for when API data is unavailable
- Used pale green text color to distinguish spacecraft names
- Added dashed orbit lines for artificial satellites
- Scaled distances appropriately for visualization
- Implemented proper z-indexing for spacecraft visibility

11. Moon Implementation:
- Added natural satellites for planets:
  - Earth's Moon
  - Mars' Phobos and Deimos
  - Jupiter's Galilean moons
  - Saturn's major moons
  - Uranus' largest moons
  - Neptune's Triton
- Used silver-blue color (#b0c4de) for moon names
- Implemented proper orbital mechanics for each moon
- Scaled sizes and distances for visibility
- Added hover effects and name labels
- Ensured proper z-indexing relative to parent planets

12. Pluto Restoration:
- Restored Pluto with proper orbital characteristics
- Implemented 1400px orbit width
- Added brown gradient coloring
- Ensured visibility with proper z-indexing (18)
- Added hover effects and name label
- Integrated with NASA Horizons API for position updates
- Implemented fallback calculations using accurate orbital period

These changes have resulted in a comprehensive visualization of the solar system, including planets, dwarf planets, major asteroids, significant comets, spacecraft, and natural satellites, all with accurate orbital mechanics and visual distinctions.
