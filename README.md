## üéØ Development Process
This project was developed using an innovative "vibe coding" approach, leveraging several AI tools:

### AI Assistance
- **Cursor AI**: Primary development environment using:
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code generation and problem-solving
  - Composer for complex feature integration
- **Audio-to-Text Tools**:
  - SuperWhisper: Voice command transcription
  - Wispr Flow: Natural language processing for development flow

This approach allowed for a more natural and intuitive development process, combining traditional coding with AI-assisted development and voice-based programming.
